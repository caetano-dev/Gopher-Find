# Gopher Find - Work in progress

Gopher Find is a faster alternative to [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) written in [Golang](https://go.dev/).

This project is still under development and new features will be added soon.

All of the websites Gopher Finds look for were extracted from the Sherlock project.

## Known issues

- Some websites return false positives. This is caused because Gopher Find uses status codes to determine if a username is valid or not. In the future, support for error messages in the page will be added.
